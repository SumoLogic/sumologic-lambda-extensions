AWS Lambda Extensions lets you integrate Lambda with your favorite tools for monitoring, observability, security, and governance. Extensions enable you and your preferred tooling vendors to plug into Lambdaâ€™s lifecycle and integrate more deeply into the Lambda execution environment.

This repository contains SumoLogic AWS Lambda extension.

# AWS Layer Version

The Sumo Logic lambda extension is available as an AWS public Layer. The latest layer is:

For x86_64 use:

    arn:aws:lambda:<AWS_REGION>:956882708938:layer:sumologic-extension-amd64:2

For arm64 use:

    arn:aws:lambda:<AWS_REGION>:956882708938:layer:sumologic-extension-arm64:2


- AWS_REGION - Replace with your AWS Lambda Region.

### Receive logs during AWS Lambda execution time
All the logs that are not sent to Sumo Logic during the Execution phase of the AWS Lambda, are sent during the shutdown phase instead. For more details on phases on the lifecycle and AWS Lambda phases please see the[ AWS documentation ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-context.html).

If you would like to always send logs during the execution phase however, you can add extra execution time via a sleep function at the end of lambda code, which will give your extension time to run and send logs to Sumo Logic. We recommend setting this to two seconds.

# Using Lambda extension in custom container images
